    <h5>Exploration History</h5>

    <p>The first European contact with North America was that of the medieval Norse settlers arriving via Greenland. 
        For several years after AD 1000 they lived in a village on the tip of the Greath Northern Penninsula, known todays as L'Anse aux Meadows. Remnants and Artifacts of the occupation
        can still be seen at L'Anse aux Meadows, now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The island was inhabited by the Beothuk (known as skrælingjar in Greenlandic Norse) and later by Mi'kmaq.

    <p> From the late 15th Century, European explores like John Cabot, João Fernandes Lavrador, Gaspar Corte-Real, Jacques Cartier and others began exploration.</p>
    <br />

    <p>John Cabot (1450-1499), commissioned by King Henry VII of England, landed on the North East coast of North America in 1497. The exact location of his landing is unknown but the 500th anniversary of
        his landing was commemorated in Bonavista. The 1497 voyage has generated much debate among historians, with various points in Newfoundland, and Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia, most of identified as the likely landing place.
