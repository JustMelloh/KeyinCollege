    <h1>History of the Olympics</h1>
    <h5>The Ancient Games</h5>
    <hr>

    <p>According to legend, the ancient Olympic Games, were founded by <u>Heracles</u> (the Roman Hercules), a sone of
        Zeus. Yet the first Olympic Games for which we still have written
        records were held in 776 BCE (though it is generally believed that the Games had been going on for many years
        already.)

                <p>A naked runner named Coroebus won the sole event at these Olympics<br>called the stade - a run of
                    approximately 192 meters. This made Coroebus the very<br>
                    first Olympic champion in history.</p>

            <p>The ancient Olympic Games grew and continues to be played every four years for nearly 1200 years.
                In 393 CE, the Roman Emperor of Theodosius I abolished the Games because of their pagan influences.

            <h5>The Modern Games</h5>
            <hr>

            <p>Approximately 1500 years later, a Frenchmen named <u>Pierre de Coubertin</u> began their revival.
                After examining the education of the German, British, and American children. Coubertin decided that it
                was exercise, more specifically sports, that made a more well-rounded and vigorous person.</p>

            <p>Coubertin's attemps to get France interested in sports was not met with enthusiasm. Still, Coubertin
                persisted.
                Coubertin first pitched his idea to revive the Olyimpic Games at a meeting of the Union des Sports
                Athl√©tiques in
                Paris on November 25, 1982, Coubertin stated,</p>
            <blockquote>"Let us export our oarsmen, our runners, our fencers into other lands. That is the true Free
                Trade of the
                future; and the day is is introduced into Europe
                the cause of Preace will have received a new and stong ally. It inspires me to touch upon another step I
                now propose
                and in it I shall ask that the help you have given me
                hitherto will extend again, so that toether we may attempt to realise, upon a basis suitable to the
                conditions of
                our modern life, the splendid and beneficent task
                of reviving the Olympic Games."
            </blockquote>

            <p>His speech did not inspire action. Two yearslater, Coubertin organized a meeting with 79 delegates who
                represented nine countries. This time, Coubertin aroused interest.
                The delegates at the conference voted unanimously for the Olympic Games. The delegates also decided to
                have Coubertin constructan international committee to organize the Games. This committee became the
                International Olympic Committee (IOC).

            <h5>The First Modern Olympics</h5>
            <hr />
            <p>The very first modern Olympic Games opened in the first week of April 1896. Since the Greek government
                had been unable to fund construction of a stadium,
                a wealthy Greek architect, Georgios Averoff, donated one million drachmas (over $100,000) to restore the
                <u>Panathenaic Stadium</u>,
                originally built in 330 BC for the Olympic Games.
            </p>
            <p>Since the Games were not well publicized internationally, contestants were not nationally chosen but
                rather came individually and at their own expense.
                Some contestants were tourists who happened to be in the area during the Games.
                Athletes wore their athletic club uniform rather than a national team one.
            </p>
            <p>Events at the first modern Olympic Games were:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Pole Vaulting</li>
                <li>Sprints</li>
                <li>Shot put</li>
                <li>Weight lifting</li>
                <li>Swimming</li>
                <li>Cycling</li>
                <li>Target Shooting</li>
                <li>Tennis</li>
                <li>Marathon</li>
                <li>Gymnastics</li>

            </ul>

                <p>James B. Conolly (United Sates), winner of the hop, step and jump was the first Olympic champion of
                    the modern Olympic Games.</p>

            <p>Approximately 300 athletes participated, representing thirteen countries. The Olympic Games have been
                held every 4 years, with the exception of the war years, since 1896.</p>
            
            <h5>Interesting Olympic Facts</h5>
            <hr>
            <p>The Official <u>Olympic Flag</u> was created by de Coubertin in 1914. It contains five interconnected
                rings on a white background.
                The five rings symbolize the five continents and are blue, yellow, black, green, and red.
                The colors were chosen because at least one of them appeared on theflag of every country in the world.
            </p>
            
            <p>The Olympic Motto was founded in 1921 by de Coubertin who borrowed a Latin phrase from his friend,
                Father Henri Didon, for the Olympic motto: Citius, Altius, Fortius ("Swifter, Higher, Stronger").
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>"In the name of all competitors, I promise that we shall take part in these Olympic Games,
                respecting and abiding by the rules that govern them,
                in the true spirit of sportsmanship, for the glory of sport and the honor of our teams."
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>The <u>Olympic Flame</u>is lit at the ancient site of Olympia by women wearing ancient-style robes and
                using a curved mirror and the sun.
                The Olympic Torch is passed from runner to runner from the ancient site of Olympia to the stadium in the
                hosting city.
                The flame is then kept alight until the Games have concluded
            </p>
            
            <p>The Olympic Medals are designed especially for each individual Olympic Games by the host city's
                organizing committee.
                Each medal must be at least three millimeters thick and 60 millimeters in diameter.
                Also, the gold and silver Olympic medals must be made out of 92.5 percent silver, with the gold medal
                covered in six grams of gold.
            </p>
            
            <p>Women were first allowed to participate in 1900 at the second modern Olympic Games. </p>
