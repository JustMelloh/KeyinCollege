                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abacus" target="_blank">abacus</href></a>. When the beads
                    on the abacus are moved around, according to programming rules memorized by the user, all regular
                    arithmetic problems can be done. In 1671, <span class=" nameStyle">Gottfried Wilhelm von
                        Leibniz</span> invented a computer that was
                    built in 1694. It could add, and, after changing some things around, multiply. About a century later
                    <span class=" nameStyle">Thomas of Colmar</span> created the first successful mechanical
                    calculator that could add, subtract,
                    multiply,
                    and divide.

                        <li>In 1812, <span class=" nameStyle">Babbage</span> realized that many long
                            calculations were really a series of predictable
                            actions
                            that were constantly repeated. He began to design an automatic mechanical calculating
                            machine,
                            which he called a difference <span class = "techStyles">engine</span>.
                        </li>

                        <li><span class=" nameStyle">Herman Hollerith</span> and <span class=" nameStyle">James
                                Powers</span> made a step towards automated computing
                            with the
                            development of punched cards. Reading errors were reduced dramatically, workflow increased,
                            and stacks of punched cards could be used as memory of almost unlimited size. For more than
                            50
                            years, punched card machines did most of the world's first business computing.

                        <li>The start of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II" target="_blank">World War
                                II</a> produced a large need for computer capacity. In 1942, <span

                            and <span class=" nameStyle">John W. Mauchly</span> decided to build a high -
                            speed electronic computer to do the job. Known
                            as <span class = "techStyles">ENIAC</span>, this machine could multiply two numbers at a rate of 300 per second.
                        </li>

                        <br />

                        <li>Early in the 50's two important engineering discoveries changed the image of the computer
                            field
                            - <span class="nameStyle">Magnetic Core Memory</span> and <span
                                class="nameStyle">Transistor</span> - <span class="techStyles">Circuit Elements.</span>
                            These technical discoveries
                            quickly
                            found their way into computers. Such computers were mostly found in large computer centers
                            operated by industry, government, and private laboratories.
                        </li>

                        <br />

                        <li>In the 1960's, efforts to design and develop the fastest possible computer with the greatest
                            capacity reached a turning point with the Stretch computer by <span class = "techStyles">IBM</span>. Stretch was made with the
                            fastest access time, and total capacity in the vicinity of 100,000,000 words.
                        </li>

                        <br />

                        <li>Many companies, some new to the computer field, introduced programmable <a

                            supplied with software packages in the 1970’s. The "shrinking" trend continued with the
                            introduction of personal computers (PC's), which are programmable machines small enough and
                            inexpensive enough to be purchased and used by individuals. Many companies, such as <span class = "techStyles">Apple
                            Computer</span> and <span class = "techStyles">Radio Shack</span> introduced very successful PCs in the 1970’s.
                        </li>

                        <br />

                        <li>By the late 1980’s, some personal computers were run by
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microprocessor" target="_blank">microprocessors
                                </href></a> that, handling 32 bits
                            of data at a time, could process about 4,000,000 instructions per second.
                        </li>

                        <br />

                        <li>Computer networking, e-mail and the Internet, and electronic publishing are just a few of
                            the
                            applications that have grown in recent years. Computers continue to decrease in price,
                            offering
                            the promise that soon, “computers will reside in most homes, offices, and schools”.
