# Text Elements
UX Design and Career insights, Niamh Redmond

There are different skills that differ and not everyone is going to be good at all the aspects of UX design.
A lot of people have a misconstrued idea on what UX design is. User experience differentiates from User Interface ( Visual Design. )


A big question is Can I easily use it v Do I want to use it?
UX isn't just about users it's also about what the business wants and the constraints on a technical side.
